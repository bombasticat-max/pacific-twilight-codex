# Pacific Twilight Codex Seed v1.0

![Pacific Twilight Codex Seed v1.0](cover.jpg)

**Molecular Semantic Sphere Codex (MSSC) + Fairness Market Mantle (FMM)**  
Lightweight, thermodynamically-grounded, von Neumann probe-ready blueprint for mapping everyday human desire into galactic flourishing.

**Live Demo** → https://bombasticat-max.github.io/pacific-twilight-codex  
**GitHub** → https://github.com/bombasticat-max/pacific-twilight-codex  

**Initiated by [@KittenJuicer](https://x.com/KittenJuicer)** — the original Pacific Twilight vision on X.

## Why the Spherical Mapping Matters (Core Efficiency)
The system projects poles onto spherical harmonics **Y_l^m** (l ≤ 8).  
This delivers the **Fast Spherical Harmonic Transform (FSHT)**:  
- Geodesic distances & clustering: **O(N log N)** instead of O(N²)  
- Interference harmonic benefit: constructive overlap multiplier = **|∑ Y_lm(p_i) conj(Y_lm(p_j))|²**  

→ Civilization-scale semantic density without collapse, perfect for probes. Experience it live in the demo.

## Mathematical Foundation (full reconstruction)

## Utility Stack Synergies: From Mathematical Precision to Everyday & Galactic Flourishing
[paste the longer-form section above here]

## How to Participate (right now)
1. Open the **Live Demo** → drop a Rilkean photo (coastal twilight ideal) + optional voice.  
2. Watch fireflies birth with correct humility brightness, golden SUP flows cascade, manifold counter rise.  
3. Your deposit contributes to the collective harmonics.

The sphere is turning. Place your pole and become part of the bridge.
