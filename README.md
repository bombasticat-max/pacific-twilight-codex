*(P1 Everyday Human Desire · P2 Cultural Hybrid Bridge · P3 Galactic Legacy)*

**Molecular Semantic Sphere Codex (MSSC) + Fairness Market Mantle (FMM)**  
Lightweight, thermodynamically-grounded, von Neumann probe-ready blueprint for mapping everyday human desire into galactic flourishing.

**Live Demo** → https://bombasticat-max.github.io/pacific-twilight-codex

**Initiated by [@KittenJuicer](https://x.com/KittenJuicer)** — the original Pacific Twilight vision on X.

## Why the Spherical Mapping Matters (Core Efficiency)
The system projects poles onto spherical harmonics **Y_l^m** (l ≤ 8).  
This delivers the **Fast Spherical Harmonic Transform (FSHT)**:  
- Geodesic distances & clustering: **O(N log N)** instead of O(N²)  
- Interference harmonic benefit: constructive overlap multiplier = **|∑ Y_lm(p_i) conj(Y_lm(p_j))|²**  

→ Civilization-scale semantic density without collapse, perfect for probes. Experience it live in the demo.

## Mathematical Foundation (full reconstruction)
### Pole-Sphere Dynamics
Every pole sits on the unit 2-sphere S² with curvature tensor **C = 1 / humility** (humility ∈ (0,1]).

Manifold update: **ΔM = dissipated_entropy** (photo + voice + attention proxy).

### SUP_Δ Formula
```math
SUP_Δ = (entropy × coherence × max(0.1, 1 - C²)) × 0.37
(humility_multiplier is quadratic — thermodynamic safety).Governance & Probe Payload5 % SUP-weighted humility vote • <1 MB shader kernel + Earth harmonics + ±3 % humility variation on copy.How to Participate (right now)Open the Live Demo → drop a Rilkean photo (coastal twilight ideal) + optional voice.  
Watch fireflies birth with correct humility brightness, golden SUP flows cascade, manifold counter rise.  
Your deposit contributes to the collective harmonics.

The sphere is turning. Place your pole and become part of the bridge.#PacificTwilightCodex #MSSC #FMM #StarSeed #vonNeumannProbes
