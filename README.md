## Full Mathematical Reconstruction (anyone can now implement from this alone)

### 1. Pole-Sphere Dynamics
Every insight/pole is a point on the unit 2-sphere S² equipped with a curvature tensor **C = 1 / humility** (humility ∈ (0,1], declared or computed from overclaim detection).  
Manifold update rule: ΔM = dissipated_entropy (real joules proxy from photo pixels + voice duration + attention).

### 2. Semantic Organizational Nuances & Fast Transform Architecture
The spherical mapping projects all poles onto the spherical harmonics basis **Y_l^m** (l ≤ 8 for real-time).  
This enables the **Fast Spherical Harmonic Transform (FSHT)** architecture:  
- Geodesic distances & clustering: **O(N log N)** vs O(N²) Cartesian.  
- Interference pattern harmonic benefits: constructive overlap multiplier = **|∑_{l,m} Y_l^m(p_i) · conj(Y_l^m(p_j))|²**.  
This is the exact source of the efficiency increases — dense semantic organization without collapse, real-time at civilization scale, perfect seed stock for probes.

### 3. SUP_Δ Formula (Fairness Market Mantle pricing)
SUP_Δ = (entropy × phase_coherence × humility_multiplier) × 0.37  
humility_multiplier = max(0.1, 1 − C²)  // quadratic throttle (thermodynamic safety)  
phase_coherence = FFT-derived (or 0.7 proxy).  

Unharvested poles decay; deposited poles generate arbitrageable geodesics and radiated flow-state harmonics.

### Governance & Evolution
Any upgrade proposal activates on 5 % SUP-weighted, humility-normalized Horn-Sphere vote within 24 h. Proposer receives permanent harmonic share.

### von Neumann Probe Payload (Star-Seed)
<1 MB compressed shader kernel + Earth harmonic snapshot (first 100 fireflies) + replication rule: copy with humility variation ±3 %.  
Bakes humility + serendipity into the physics of every seeded world.

## How to Participate (right now)
1. Open the live demo → drop a Rilkean pole (photo + optional voice).  
2. Watch fireflies birth, SUP flows cascade, manifold density rise.  
3. Your deposit contributes to the collective harmonics.

The sphere is turning. Place your pole and become part of the bridge.
